Arrival of King Midas Event

When the mouse is clicked, a 5x5 area surrounding the cursor turns to gold and King Midas and a powerful wizard are
summoned. Any miners caught in the area are turned to gold miners. Gold miners are unable to collect ore and transform
any ore they touch into gold ore. Gold ore can be collected by regular miners. King Midas chases untransformed miners
and turns them into gold miners. The wizard attempts to return the gold miners to their original state. Midas is
faster than most miners while the wizard is slower than most of the miners.
